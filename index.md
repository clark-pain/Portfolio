## Professional, Outdoor Enthusiast, Enjoyer of Life

One of my favorite things to do is to solve problems of all shapes and sizes. I spend most of my time at work discovering more effective ways of communicateing information, anticipating future needs of the AF/Intelligence enterprise, and deploying new methods/tools designed to make our products more relevant to our customers. What really gets me excited, though, is when I get to be involved with a project in a real hands-on way. Finding those hard problems that don't have straight-forward solutions requires real creativity and ingenuity, which is where I think I excel. 

I believe that for every complex problem, there exists an elegant solution that best meets all requirements. I am not one to compromise on outcome for convenience's sake, and I am constantly working to create the best product possible.

## Bio
I called San Diego, CA home for the first 18 years of my life, and that has invariably had a lasting effect on me. I love everything outdoor-related, having spent many of my formative years on the ocean, in the mountains, and on the ski slopes (However, I was spoiled just a tad, as anyone who knows me knows that I will usually make some comment about the weather any time it is more than 5 degrees above or below 75F). Fast-forward to 2019 and I still spend the vast majority of my free time outdoors running, hiking, or on my bike. Work-life balance is very important to me, as I believe that much of life's enjoyment comes from exploring new places, meeting new people, and seeking-out new experiences.

### Passions
I am passionate about our future. The world is changing at a dizzying rate, which means we need to innovate create solutions faster than ever before if we want to stay ahead of the curve. We need to create invest in technologies that allow us to better utilize our limited resources, be they human, natural, or strategic.
