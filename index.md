![image-left]({{ '/docs/Headshot - Edited.jpg' | absolute_url }}){: .align-left} My name is Clark Pain, and I am currently a Captain in the US Air Force, serving as an Intelligence Officer in beautiful Denver, Colorado.  

## Clark: Professional, Outdoor Enthusiast, Enjoyer of Life

One of my favorite things to do is to solve problems of all shapes and sizes. I spend most of my time at work discovering more effective ways of communicateing information, anticipating future needs of the AF/Intelligence enterprise, and deploying new methods/tools designed to make our products more relevant to our customers. What really gets me excited, though, is when I get to be involved with a project in a real hands-on way. Finding those hard problems that don't have straight-forward solutions requires real creativity and ingenuity, which is where I think I excel. 

I believe that for every complex problem, there exists an elegant solution that best meets all requirements. I am not one to compromise on outcome for convenience's sake, and I am constantly working to create the best product possible.
